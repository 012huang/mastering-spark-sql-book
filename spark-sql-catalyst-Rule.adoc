== [[Rule]] Catalyst Rule

`Rule` is a <<ruleName, named>> transformation that can be <<apply, applied>> to (i.e. executed on) a link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[TreeNode] (usually link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[expression trees] or link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[logical] or link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[physical] plans).

[[apply]]
[source, scala]
----
apply(plan: TreeType): TreeType
----

NOTE: `TreeType` is the type of a tree that a `Rule` operates on, e.g. link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan], link:spark-sql-SparkPlan.adoc[SparkPlan] or link:spark-sql-Expression.adoc[Expression].

[[ruleName]]
`Rule` has the rule name (that is simply a class name).
